        "description": "Solar panels harness the power of sunlight to generate clean and renewable electricity for homes. These panels are typically installed on the roof or in the yard where they can receive direct sunlight throughout the day. Solar energy is converted into electricity through photovoltaic cells within the panels, which can then be used to power appliances, lighting, and other electrical devices in the home. Solar panels can significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for grid electricity, resulting in lower utility bills and reduced carbon emissions. Additionally, many governments offer incentives and rebates for installing solar panels, making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly investment for sustainable living."
